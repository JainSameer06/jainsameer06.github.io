Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer at [Supernormal](https://supernormal.com/), where I evaluate large language models (LLMs) that write meeting notes. 

I received a master's degree from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked on evaluating NLP systems and societally-aware machine learning with a host of great researchers, collaborators, and mentors, including [Chunting Zhou](https://violet-zct.github.io/), [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/), [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/), [Hoda Heidari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/), [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/), and [Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io/).

Prior to CMU, I was a software engineer at Samsung Research, where I built memory-efficient NLP systems for on-device deployment.

I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science from BITS Pilani.
