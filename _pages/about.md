Hello! I'm a machine learning engineer at Pinterest, where I develop the models responsible for ranking and recommending pins on users' homefeed. Prior to this, I developed and evaluated large language models (LLMs) that write meeting notes at [Supernormal](https://supernormal.com/). 

I received a master's degree from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. During graduate school, my two main areas of interest were 1) evaluation of large language models and 2) AI for social good. I led some of the earliest research leveraging LLMs to [evaluate the quality of text](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.537.pdf). I also led a collaboration between CMU and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) utilizing [LLMs for environmental conservation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11818.pdf). During my time at CMU, I got the opportunity to collaborate with a host of amazing researchers and mentors, including [Chunting Zhou](https://violet-zct.github.io/), [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/), [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/), [Hoda Heidari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/), [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/), and [Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io/).

Prior to CMU, I was a software engineer at Samsung Research, where I built memory-efficient NLP systems for the on-device deployment of Samsung's personal assistant--Bixby.

I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science from BITS Pilani.
